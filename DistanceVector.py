# Distance Vector project for CS 6250: Computer Networks
#
# This defines a DistanceVector (specialization of the Node class)
# that can run the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The TODOs are all related 
# to implementing BF. Students should modify this file as necessary,
# guided by the TODO comments and the assignment instructions. This 
# is the only file that needs to be modified to complete the project.
#
# Student code should NOT access the following members, otherwise they may violate
# the spirit of the project:
#
# topolink (parameter passed to initialization function)
# self.topology (link to the greater topology structure used for message passing)
#
# Copyright 2017 Michael D. Brown
# Based on prior work by Dave Lillethun, Sean Donovan, Jeffrey Randow, new VM fixes by Jared Scott and James Lohse.
